this is worst notepad i have ever used. If anyone can make it better , i will give them , 10,000,000 atoms of Oxygen.

it uses tkinter messege box and dialogue box and os library.

[] 4 main functions for file:

1. new : It will set the title of nre file as Untitled-Notepad , file is the global variable to hold data of file before saving
2. Openfile : It uses a function from os to open file with default extension (If the file is created using newfile) and delets previous file data .
3. save file: It uses os function to save file with initial file name and type .
4. Exit : it quits the window 

{Note: Autosave feature doesnt exisits. If you are interested , you can play and add new such features.}

Three cut\copy\paste functions use event generate which is a part of tkinter.

about function shows a window with about.

and other tkinter functions like menu, add_command , etc are used to make the window.
