This calculor uses tkinter library for its GUI.

It consists of three main functions:

1. Press : each button uses this function to input the expression to be solved. 

2. EqualPress: when "Equal" button is pressed , this function activates and uses {eval()} function to evaluate the expression.
and store it again in expression variable.

[equation variable is the variable responsibe for displaying text in this case numbers and expression stores the value for evaluation.]

3. Clear :  clear function totally clears the expression variable thus the display.

{hint: A is H, B is I , if keyboard is QWERTY , then each symbol is a lie...}
